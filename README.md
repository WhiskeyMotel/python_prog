#HELP FOR NOOBIES!!! GITHUB HINT
        git add "file"/"folder"/* 	
1. mark file/folder that send to repo 1

        git commit -m "text" 
2. commit the file 2

        git push
3. upload to repo 3

        git commit -am "text" 
4. commit deleted file 4

        git status 
5. useful to check which files you marked 5

Have some troubles with uploading? Use repo_init.exe from my c_prog repo (64 bit only, in Russian)
