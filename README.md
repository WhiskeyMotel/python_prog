#HELP FOR NOOBIES!!! GITHUB HINT
        git add "file"/"folder"/* 	
mark file/folder that send to repo
        git commit -m "text" 
commit the file
        git push
upload to repo
        git commit -am "text" 
commit deleted file
        git status 
useful to check which files you marked

Have some troubles with uploading? Use repo_init.exe from my c_prog repo (64 bit only, in Russian)
